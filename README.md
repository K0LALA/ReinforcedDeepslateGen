# Deepslate Generator

This mod is very simple, as the name suggests, it adds a deepslate generator to Minecraft, so you can industrialize it if needed.<br>
For it to work, place a **reinforced deepslate block** underneath the point where lave is going to collide to water and a **deepslate block** will generate instead of a stone one.
